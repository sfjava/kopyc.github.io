So, we all know the country is divided. <br />
Unfortunately, far too many believe they’re right and the other side is wrong, dead wrong...
and if we can just erase their point of view, "everything would be better". 
		</p>
		<p>
What I struggle with is that the extreme voices on both sides actually don’t represent the bell curve and the 80% of the majority... seated in the middle.
		</p>
		<p>
But the more those voices on the extreme sides talk and argue their opinion... The more the 80% in the middle like myself, want to duck a head in the sand and tune it all out.
		</p>
		<p>
This thread has pulled my head up and out of the sand and caused me to say a few things. 
		</p>
		<p>
Both of my cousins and I have been chatting over these last couple days over the rhetoric on this thread, a thread once a happy place to return to for dose of family,
history, commonality, and love of dairy farms, barns and memories of cherished family members who we’ve all grown up with and who have made us who we are today. 
		</p>
		<p>
I remember fondly a warm summer day as a young girl asking the avid gardener Grandma Jane which flower was her favorite color.
		</p>
		<p>
We were standing on the steps that lead to the kitchen of the old farmhouse, in the middle of gardens full of trumpet vine, hollyhock, snap dragons, portulaca and countless others. 
		</p>
		<p>
She sheepishly replied, “Oh, I could never choose one over the others.”
		</p>
		<p>
Ironically, growing up in such a small town and being exposed to her generation’s opinions of color...
she unfortunately felt comfortable only with those very much like herself. We’ve all heard her and her generation speak of other races and groups like Archie Bunker would have. 
		</p>
		<p>
We forgave Grandma for her life’s views, given where she came from. <br />
A limited and narrow window to differences in others formed prejudices. 
		</p>
		<p>
Instead, we focused on her love. And I’d like to think that if she was with us today, she’d still say - I would never pick one color over another. 
		</p>
		<p>
The garden is best with variety. 
		</p>
		<p>
By now, I hope she’d have met people of all the colors… And, knowing that she was from immigrants and that she knew of their struggles to get here,
I imagine her also being more accepting of one another… especially of those who had to fight to get here. 
		</p>
		<p>
Politicians on both sides would do well to hear from Grandma Jane. 
		</p>
		<p>
Granted… on policy:
Opening the float gates and allowing folks in without rules nor systems in place to handle it… negatively impacted endless communities. <br />
Slamming the gate shut, ripping, families apart, accepting only the most elite at $5 million a person… profoundly impacts those so desperately in need. <br />
Not a path I’d like to see forward either.
		</p>
		<p>
Where is a voice of reason?  Law and order AND acceptance of differences?
		</p>
		<p>
Which brings me to the voices screaming on the conservative networks about gender.
Why should anyone feel like they have a right to weigh in on anyone else’s life, personal desires and goals?
Their lives don’t impact anyone but themselves. 
		</p>
		<p>
I guess I mention all of this in our family thread for the heated rhetoric that bubbled up a bit ago.
Given that half of our country thinks the other half is so very wrong, it hurts me to think that our family would assume that words
like this could be spoken without potentially hurting someone else in our family. 
		</p>
		<p>
Apologies. It seems a sleeping pain has been opened. My neice Sadie, Bobby’s only daughter, died in the streets of Albany.
And it wasn’t because Albany is a sanctuary city. It wasn’t because of an illegal immigrant.
		</p>
		<p>
It wasn’t because of lack of trying.
		</p>
		<p>
It was because she lost the battle to bi-polar schizophrenia as a heroin addict. 
		</p>
		<p>
She told my brother she preferred to be as far away from reality as she could get. 
		</p>
		<p>
He prayed to God to take her, to rescue her, daily. 
		</p>
		<p>
She was different than us.<br />
Our world as is wasn’t able to be a home to her. At least now she’s home with the rest of our family who passed before. 
		</p>
		<p>
<b>Diversity</b> means understanding that people are different; God actually created us this way. <br />
<b>Equity</b> means we should all get an equal shot at succeeding in this life. <br />
<b>Inclusion</b> means we should include all groups and accept different opinions, while allowing them to inform and better us. <br />
		</p>

Years ago, DEI Legislation was passed, led by liberals who valued the idea that when diverse ideas/people come together,
the outcome will be better even though it takes a bit longer to get there. And that if we all were in fact created equally in the eyes of God,
who gets to dictate who belongs, who gets better education, who gets more breaks? No legislation is perfect - but this piece attempted to make a place for these ideals. 
		</p>
		<p>
Have you ever been on a diverse work team before? It’s challenging, time consuming, eye-opening...
And net results far better than one mind could have ever pictured.
		</p>
		<p>
Our president blamed the DEI programs for a plane that crashed... Fox reported him saying that it was because of a sub-par hire due to DEI.
He said this before the wreckage even stopped smoking -- without any facts at all.
		</p>
		<p>
If I could, I would stand on the rooftop and scream with my lungs ready to explode.<br />
Words, accusations, mantras...<br />
repeated without proof...<br />
deaden the ability to judge properly. 
		</p>
		<p>
Picture the bell curve again, my friends, and if you hear an extreme voice on either side, please know it is coming from a very tiny minority of what our country and this world truly is and believes in. 
		</p>
		<p>
I pray my words will find a tiny place in hearts that have our family in common. I pray my words may crack the tiniest of light through a door closed to ideas different than yours. 
		</p>
		<p>
A final thought...
		</p>
		<p>
Mark reminded me of how Gram and Grampy had a very special gift of making each one of us feel like we were the most special. I wonder if I choose to nurture this idea I could be as beautiful at it. 
		</p>
		<p>
Sending my love,<br />
